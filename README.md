# SauceDemo-Testcases

Domain: https://www.saucedemo.com/

Testing Description:
I performed comprehensive manual testing of the SauceDemo login module to validate authentication functionality across multiple user types. The testing covered positive and negative login scenarios, input validation (blank and invalid credentials), password masking, keyboard navigation, cross-browser compatibility, performance checks, and post-login redirection. The execution identified functional, usability, and performance-related issues, including access restrictions, slow login behavior for specific users, and tab navigation defects.
